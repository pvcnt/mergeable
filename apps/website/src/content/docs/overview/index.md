We found that the "[Pull Requests](https://github.com/pulls)" page provided by GitHub is not enough in most situations to efficiently track pull requests.
It comes with four tabs associated with pre-defined search queries, that cannot be changed.
Switching between tabs is slow, and there is no way to see all pull requests from those tabs at once.

Mergeable is a better inbox for GitHub pull requests, that displays all pull requests of interest on a single page in a very flexible manner:

Mergeable is designed from the beginning to be self-hosted.
While we provide a public instance, we encourage users to host their own instance.

## Features

Self-hosting Mergeable unlocks the following features:

* **Stability:** You decide when you are ready to upgrade to a newer version.
* **Security:** Even though it does not share any confidental data, in some corporate environments it may be a requirement to host Mergeable inside the corporate network.
* **Configuration:** By deploying your own instance, you may configure it to better fit your workflow.
For example, you may connect to an internal GitHub Enterprise instance.
